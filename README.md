## What is Advent of Code?
(From the [website](https://adventofcode.com/2021/about)) <br/>
Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like. People use them as a speed contest, interview prep, company training, university coursework, practice problems, or to challenge each other.

## Why AOC?
Studying computer science makes me realize that I love solving puzzles, AOC is one of the ways to fulfill this interest. Also, coding with python is very liberating and interesting and I want to solve interesting problems with it.

## Acknowledgements
Code written in here will be written by me unless I reference it explicitly inside the .py files.
